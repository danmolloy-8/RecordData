# RecordData

This is data I collected myself, based on my own record collection. To make money since graduation, I've been selling second-hand
records, so I thought I would model them to make a predictive model. This can detect if a new record will have an increase in price
based on a number of variables.

Currently, this is a classification problem, i.e., has the price of the record increased or not. With more data, I plan to make this a linear regression problem, roughly predicting how much a record will increase in price.
I plan to feed more data into this as I continue to buy/sell records.
